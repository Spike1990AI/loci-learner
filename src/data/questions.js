    question: 'What shape is formed by the locus of points equidistant from a single point P?',
    options: [
      'A circle',
      'A straight line',
      'A square',
      'An ellipse'
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: 'All points at a fixed distance from point P form a circle with center P.'

    question: 'The locus of points equidistant from two points A and B is:',
    options: [
      'A circle passing through A and B',
      'The line joining A and B',
      'The perpendicular bisector of AB',
      'Two parallel lines'
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: 'The perpendicular bisector is the set of all points equidistant from A and B.'

    question: 'What shape is formed by the locus of points at a fixed distance from a line segment?',
    options: [
      'A rectangle',
      'Two parallel lines with semicircular ends',
      'A circle',
      'Two straight lines only'
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'This creates a "stadium" or "running track" shape - parallel lines with semicircles at the ends.'

    question: 'The angle bisector represents points that are:',
    options: [
      'Equidistant from the two lines forming the angle',
      'On one of the two lines',
      'At the midpoint of the angle',
      'Perpendicular to both lines'
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: 'Every point on the angle bisector is equidistant from both lines that form the angle.'

    options: [
      'A square with side 50km',
      'A circle with radius 50km',
      'A line 50km long',
      'Two parallel lines 50km apart'
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'All points exactly 50km from the tower form a circle - this is the locus equidistant from a point.'

    question: 'Two rival pizza shops are 2km apart. Which locus shows where you would be equidistant from both shops?',
    options: [
      'A circle around both shops',
      'The line joining the two shops',
      'The perpendicular bisector between them',
      'Two circles, one around each shop'
    ],

    question: 'A railway line runs straight for 500m. A safety zone extends 10m from the track. What shape is this zone?',
    options: [
      'A rectangle',
      'A stadium shape (rectangle with semicircular ends)',
      'A circle',
      'Just two parallel lines'
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'The locus 10m from a line segment forms a stadium shape with the track down the middle.'
  },
  {
    id: 8,
    question: 'Two roads meet at a crossroads forming an angle. A new park bench must be equidistant from both roads. Where should it be placed?',
    options: [
      'At the corner where the roads meet',
      'On one of the roads',
      'Anywhere along the angle bisector',
      'At the midpoint of one road'
